# Introduction to Electronic Sensors
Electronic sensors can detect everything from light to distance to acceleration. Sensors are how a product senses anything in the real-world, and there is an almost endless array of them available.

Sensors measure real-world quantities, which are then converted into an electrical signal. Actuators, on the other hand, take an electrical signal and convert it into a physical form. For example, motors and speakers are two of the most basic types of actuators.

Sensors are sometimes referred to as input transducers, and actuators as output transducers. Transducer is a very broad term that refers to any device that converts between an electrical quantity and a real-word quantity.

There is such a huge variety of sensors that it would be overwhelming to describe in detail how they all work. So let’s begin with an overview of sensors that are most often used in tech products.

Instead, let’s look at the most popular types of sensors used in tech products.

# Analog vs Digital
There are many ways to categorize sensors. One of the most basic ways is analog versus digital. The difference between analog and digital sensors relates to how the sensor outputs the measured data. It rarely has anything to do with the sensing mechanism itself (motor encoders being a notable exception).

For example, many sensors provide a voltage that varies proportionately with the quantity being measured. This voltage is an analog signal that varies continuously between two voltage thresholds.
